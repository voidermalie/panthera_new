# Hello 👁️
[This](https://voidermalie.github.io/panthera_new) project was part of my Web Developer course at OpenClassrooms. It is the optimized version of an existing website, so it meets the [WCAG standards](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) for accessibility and performs better in search engines.

I have boosted the initially poor SEO, accessibility and performance scores of the site to 100, 100 and 98 respectively.
